# 🧮 React Counter App with Theme Toggle

## 📘 Introduction to React & `useState`

React is a popular JavaScript library for building **user interfaces**, especially single-page applications where updates happen dynamically without reloading the page. It uses a **component-based architecture**, meaning the UI is broken into independent, reusable pieces.

### 🔹 What is `useState`?

`useState` is a **React Hook** that allows you to add **state** to functional components. It returns an array with two values:
- The **current state**
- A **function to update the state**

Example:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0); ```jsx
