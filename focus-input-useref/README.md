# Focus Input with useRef Hook

This React project demonstrates how to use the `useRef` hook to access and manipulate DOM elements.

## 🔍 useRef Hook

The `useRef()` hook returns a mutable object which does not cause a re-render when updated. It is typically used to:

- Reference a DOM element directly
- Store a value that persists across renders

## 🚀 Features

- Focus an input field by clicking a button
- Clean and minimal styling
